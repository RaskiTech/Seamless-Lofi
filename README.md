# Seamless Lofi

Welcome to Seamless Lofi, a project that utilizes AI and other techniques to create an infinite stream of lofi music. The goal of this project is to provide listeners with an ever-changing musical experience, ensuring they never get tired of hearing the same notes repeatedly.

You can adjust the volume and the pace of the music to suit your preferences. The project is not necessarily finished, and is possibly improved in the future.
